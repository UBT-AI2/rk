# This file demonstrates how you can run a benchmark series. Of course, to
# observe relevant cache effects, you need to consider larger problem sizes
# that are a challenge for the cache.
#
# After using this script to run the benchmarks and produce a log file like
# this
#
#  ./benchmark bruss2d-mix example.log
#
# You can produce a table for later postprocessing and plotting by
#
#   ./log2tab --head < example.log > example.csv
