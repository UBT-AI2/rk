	Update copyright year to 2021.

	Updated documentation.

	* README.md

	Improvements of build process.

	* .depend: Omit system includes such as mpi.h
	* bin/.force_tracking: Ensure that the bin directory exists when
	the repo is cloned.
	* Makefile: Allow to overwrite compiler and config.
	* Makefile: Changed order of implementations for "make check" and
	"make time".

	Improved output, debugging and benchmarking.

	* src/main.c: Result output with more digits.
	* include/tools.h (step_control) [DUMP]: Save current solution
	vector in step_control().
	* log2tab: Parses text output and produces CSV table for further
	processing.
	* benchmark: Demo script for automating measurement series.

	New implementations F and Fblock.

	* src/impl/*/F.c
	* src/impl/*/Fblock.c

	New test problem LV (multiple Lotka-Volterra equations).

	* include/config.h
	* src/problems/lv.c

	New embedded RK method by Verner (VERNER65).

	* include/methods.h
	* src/methods.c (VERNER65)

	Added several non-embedded (fixed-step-size) methods (HEUN2, RK4,
	SSPRK3).

	* include/config.h: Comments and T_END.
	* include/methods.h: Prototypes.
	* include/tools.h (h_new_acc, step_control): Handle fixed step
	size case (tol <= 0.0).
	* src/main.c: Decide and pass right value of tol.
	* src/methods.c (HEUN2, RK4, SSPRK3): Initialization of method
	coefficients.
	* src/tools.c (initial_stepsize): Suitable initial step size.
	* src/impl/mpi/PipeD2.c: Same communication as for accepted steps.
	* log2tab: Updated patterns. Included initial step size as column
	h0.

	Improved structure of implementations.

	* src/impl/*/E.c: Sourced out kernels to block-inline.h.
	Also renamed calls in src/impl/*/A.c.

	Performance improvement I: Inner tiling.

	* src/impl/*/PipeD*.c

	Performance improvement II: ode_eval_range()

	* include/block-inline.h (block_rhs, tiled_block*)
	* include/ode.h (ode_eval_rng)
	* src/problems/bruss2d-mix.c (ode_eval_rng)

	Performance improvement III: Exploit method coefficients equal to
	0.0.

	* include/block-inline.h
	* include/methods.h (alloc_zero_pattern, free_zero_pattern, zero_pattern)
	* src/methods.c (zero_pattern)
	All relevant implementations changed.

	Performance improvement IV; Premultiplication of coefficients by
	step size.

	* include/block-inline.h
	* include/methods.h (premult)
	* src/methods.c (premult)
	All relevant implementations changed.
